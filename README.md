 This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the integration of a graph database (Neo4j) with a Large Language Model (LLM) (Llama2) using LangChain. The objective is to enable natural language querying of the database,
 with responses formatted in a human-readable manner. This POC uses a publicly available movie dataset.
